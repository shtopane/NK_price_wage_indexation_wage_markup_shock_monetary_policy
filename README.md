# Macro Research Module: Macroeconomic Frictions
We study impulse-responses of the dynamic New Keynesian model for several types of nominal and real frictions to associated economic shocks. To solve for the aggregate dynamics, we use the Fair-Taylor method as it is
implemented in the https://econpizza.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html package.
## Topic
*The dynamic consequences of a wage markup shock in a medium scale model with price and wage indexation and different monetary policy parameters.*

## Setup and instructions
